Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)             
•  Developed a predictive model using Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and ARIMA to forecast stock prices based on historical data.
•  Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to analyze trends and improve model accuracy.
•  Achieved an accuracy of ~85% on test data, aiding in investment decision-making.

Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Stock Trading Bot

• Developed a stock trading agent using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in Python. Implemented a custom OpenAI Gym environment to simulate stock trading using real-time market data from Yahoo Finance. 
• Trained and evaluated the agent on historical stock data (AAPL) using Google Colab. Focused on action-based decision-making (buy/sell/hold) to maximize trading profits.

AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance & Cost Optimization for Cloud Infrastructure                          
• Designed a machine learning system to predict cloud infrastructure failures and optimize operational costs using performance and usage data.
 • Implemented models using Python, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost to detect anomalies and forecast component failure.
 • Integrated data analysis pipelines with visualization tools to support proactive decision-making and resource allocation.
